# ITSupportChatbot
 
This is a basic IT Support web application that helps a user diagnose basic issues through a series of yes/no questions. It uses Natural Language Processing via the Stanza library to narrow down the category and guide the user by checking off potential solutions. If a solution is still not found then a ticket will be logged for IT Support to look at.
